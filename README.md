# SOLID
1. Single Responsibility Principle:
    A class should take care of a Single Responsibility.
2. Open for Extension Closed for Modification:
    Prefer extension over modification.
3. Liskov Substitution Principle:
Parent class should be able to refer child objects seamlessly during runtime polymorphism.
